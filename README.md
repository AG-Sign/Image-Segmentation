# Image-Segmentation

•We intend to perform image segmentation. Image segmentation means that we can
group similar pixels together and give these grouped pixels the same label. The
grouping problem is a clustering problem. We want to study the use of K-means on
the Berkeley Segmentation Benchmark

•The dataset has 500 images. The test set is 200 images only. We will
report our results on the first 50 images of the test set only

•Every image pixel is a feature vector of 3-dimension {R, G, B}

•Some sample runs with [Images](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1iM02OPBUUg4jNN-UsmhFpEVUOU89WzS8) with different K in k-means
